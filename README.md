## New Features

- **Tome of Sharing** - (Includes config disable) a Tome of Sharing with a lot of options. Check out the configuration to see what it can do!
- **Vis Capacitor** - a new high-capacity Vis storage block similar to Thaumcraft's Vis Battery

- **Voidcaller Armor** - a new set of extremely powerful caster robes, currently only dropped by the Avatar of Corruption
- **Voidflame Infusion** - a new infusion enchantment that inflicts targets with a status effect that deals true damage over time and reduces healing received by 50%
